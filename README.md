# Welcome to my portfolio

My portfolio is just an online sketchbook of the websites I have made from university and during my online course at Learning People. I won't be showing all my work in it, just the ones that I think stand out from what I have so far. I will be making a better portfolio soon but for now I think I should just keep it neat and simple.

I hope you like the stuff that I have made so far!
