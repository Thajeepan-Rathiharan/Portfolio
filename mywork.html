            I decided to base this off of a real life experience collecting different point of views of insomnia and made it into an interactive story using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project was also made responsive on mobile devices and tablet devices alongside desktop devices.
            I found this project more challenging than the anime website where I was introduced to JavaScript, but like before I had a helpful teacher who helped me with the issues I had, but I worked on this one more independantly and came up with fixes myself but I can't take all the credit
